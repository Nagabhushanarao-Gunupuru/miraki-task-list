Task Management App   

Description :
This is a â€œTask Management Application" designed for managing the tasks.Task management application designs to streamline your productivity and help you achieve your goals with ease.


Approach to complete the Project :
Features:
 
   -First I divided the entire application into routes Login Route , Tasks Route etc.,


 Technologies:


   -For building and responsiveness of the application I use "React"
   - For styling I Use "CSS"
   - For Debugging I use "Browser Developers Tools" 
   
 Tools:  
   - To develop this Application I use a platform called VS code
   - For Source control --> Git 


 Why React Js :
    React Js was chosen to build more performant websites with less code when compared to Js. 
    And also it is open source with strong community and third-party packages 


 Third-party packages:
    react
    react-router-dom ---> For navigating from one route to another route 


Challenging and Exciting Approaches :
    - One of the challenging approach is navigating from one route to another route  using third-party package react-router-dom 
    - Another one is creating checked and unchecked status.


Resources :
    - For third-party packages I use "node package manager"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
